<h2>Our Goal</h2>
Student Suites wishes to develop and foster partnerships with Colleges, Universities and Community Colleges to provide the service of developing student housing. We hope to help each institution find a financial solution to create a project that is affordable for students yet provides the campus with a beautiful, new, safe recruitment tool that helps retain students yet provide a cash flow for the institution for many years.
<h2>History</h2>
Student Suites was founded in 1996 to provide stand-alone student housing to clients. Student Suites is proud to celebrate its 22nd year serving Colleges and Universities in providing total turn key development for on campus housing projects. Projects ranging from 64 â€“ 840 beds from the Upper Peninsula in Michigan and as far east as North Carolina and into the Florida Keys. All of our projects to date have been on campus and completed with little or no money contributed from clients. Projects have all opened on time and at or below budget providing our clients with a positive cash flow in the first year of operation. We specialize in providing our clients the greatest profit potential for their campus. Our experience proves that student housing is a profitable solution to Colleges and Universities.
