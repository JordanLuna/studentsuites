It starts with a simple conversation: we sit down and get to know you, your students, and your housing needs.
During this phase, we:
<ul>
 	<li>Listen to your campus representatives and your school's needs</li>
 	<li>Conduct focus groups to learn what your students want</li>
 	<li>Visit your site</li>
 	<li>Assess your amenities and technology needs</li>
 	<li>Submit a formal proposal, which includes a financial feasibility study</li>
 	<li>Conduct an environmental study</li>
 	<li>Determine the financing structure and source</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 	<li>We integrate technology into every facility.</li>
 	<li>We handle all the design details—from budget-friendly square footage to study-friendly furniture.</li>
 	<li>We support your students' unique needs with ancillary services, such as fitness centers, cafeterias, daycare centers, and more.</li>
 	<li>We work with local architects and contractors to ensure compliance with your community's ordinances and building codes.</li>
</ul>
On-campus student housing helps your school attract and retain students and can provide positive revenue stream for your college—anywhere from $25,000 to $1 million a year. Over a 30-year period, your college could earn profits one to two times the original cost of the project. Our finance team:
<ul>
 	<li>helps you bring together the right financial sources and legal representation</li>
 	<li>conducts an initial analysis and feasibility study to find the correct blend of debt service, coverage, and term</li>
 	<li>secures low-interest, tax-exempt financing</li>
 	<li>offer creative financing structures</li>
</ul>

 	<li>identifies potential challenges early because of our team-based design-build approach</li>
 	<li>hires local labor to build your project</li>
 	<li>Your doors open on time, without delays or hidden costs.</li>
 	<li>Establish weekly jobsite evaluations to inform your staff on the project's progress</li>
 	<li>Order furniture, fixtures, and equipment</li>
